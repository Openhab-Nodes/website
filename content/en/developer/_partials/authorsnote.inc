    <p>
        When I started this project, I already had been a long time contributor to the <a
            href="https://www.openhab.org">openHAB</a> project.

        isolation, capability or resource restrictions.</p>

    <p>Let's learn from design mistakes of the past! openHAB X's greatest ambition is to eliminate the trade-offs that
        home automation users have accepted for so long by providing safety and productivity, speed and ergonomics. </p>
    <p>Give openHAB X a try and see if its choices work for you.</p>
