This chapter is about collecting runtime metrics as well as Thing states over time.

Runtime metrics allow for example to identify that your sprinkler rule causes heavy CPU usage spikes in the morning. Putting that into relation to the 10s of thousands of rule invocations at the same time and you know that your rule accidentially called itself again and again instead of another rule.
