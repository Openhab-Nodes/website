Welcome to <b>The openHAB X User Guide</b>, an introductory guide about openHAB X. The open Home Automation Bus Plux X (openHAB X, <i>pronounced ˈəʊpənˈhæb ˈeks</i>) is an open source, technology agnostic home automation platform which runs as the center of your smart home!

## Who openHAB X Is For
openHAB X is for people who crave **stability** and **ease to use** in a custom home automation system and is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let’s look at a few of the most important groups.

openHAB X is for People Who &hellip;

### Don't Like Vendor Lock-Ins

openHAB's strength is it's ability to integrate a multitude of other devices and systems. It includes other home automation systems, (smart) devices and other technologies into a single solution with a uniform user interface and a common approach to automation rules.

If you can think it, odds are that you can implement it with openHAB X.

### Value Simplicity

openHAB X offers a user-interface for all kinds of configuration or automation. From the very first start to access management, device or voice control integrations and automation rules.

You do not need to type a single line in any sort of text file or drop to a command line. At the same time you always have the choice to do so, watch out for the {{< advanced >}} badge.

### Value Speed and Stability

By stability, we mean execution efficiency and long-time robustness of all involved self-healing services that openHAB X is composed of.

Speed is not only measured in processed events per second and overall efficiency (see [Design Principles](/developer/design_principles)), but alse the speed at which openHAB X lets you extend the system.

**Open Source** (Apache 2 &amp; MIT license) means, it will be around for a while. No vendor lock-in: Add your feature to the well documented, continously tested code or ask around in the community.

If you are interested in technical backgrounds of openHAB X, check out the [Developer Documentation](/developer).

## Who This Guide Is For
This guide assumes no further background on your side. We’ve tried to make the material broadly accessible and it's merely three steps to set a system up. If you do want to write complex rules that go beyond our very powerful (graphical) Trigger-Condition-Action Rule Schema, you need programming backgrounds in JavaScript.

## How to Use This Guide

In general, this guide assumes that you’re reading it in sequence from front to back. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters might not delve into details on a topic; we typically revisit the topic in a later chapter.

You’ll find two kinds of content in this guide: concept sections and project sections. In concept sections, you’ll learn about an aspect of openHAB X. In project sections, we’ll build small demonstrations together, applying what you’ve learned so far.

The chapters are outlined like this:

<split>

This guide fully embraces the potential of openHAB X to empower its users. It’s a friendly and approachable text intended to help you level up not just your knowledge of this system, but also your reach and confidence in Home Automation in general. So dive in, get ready to learn — and welcome to the openHAB X community!
