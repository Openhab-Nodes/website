Welcome to <b>The openHAB X User Guide</b>, an introductory guide about openHAB X. The open Home Automation Bus Extended (openHAB X, <i>pronounced ˈəʊpənˈhæb ˈeks</i>) is an open source, technology agnostic home automation platform which runs as the center of your smart home!
</p>

## Who openHAB X Is For
openHAB X is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let’s look at a few of the most important groups.

### People Who Don't Like Vendor Lock-Ins

openHAB's strength is it's ability to integrate a multitude of other devices and systems. It includes other home automation systems, (smart) devices and other technologies into a single solution with a uniform user interface and a common approach to automation rules.
If you can think it, odds are that you can implement it with openHAB X.

Open Source means, it will be available forever. No vendor lock-in: Add your feature to the well documented, continously tested code or ask around in the community.

### People Who Value Simplicity

openHAB X offers a user-interface for all kinds of configuration or automation. From the very first start to access management, device or voice control integrations and automation rules. You do not need to type a single line in any sort of text file or drop to a command line. At the same time you always have the coice to do so, watch out for the <i class="badge badge-primary">ADVANCED</i> badge.

### People Who Value Speed and Stability
openHAB X is for people who crave **speed**, **efficiency** and **stability** in a home automation system. By stability, we mean the execution efficiency of the different robust, self-healing services that openHAB X is composed of and the speed at which openHAB X lets you extend the system. By efficiency we mean the intuitive and quick methods to reach any device integration and automation goal.

If you are interested in technical backgrounds of openHAB X, check out the [Developer Documentation](/developer).

## Who This Guide Is For
This guide assumes no further background on your side. We’ve tried to make the material broadly accessible and it's merely three steps to set a system up. If you do want to write complex rules that go beyond our very powerful (graphical) Trigger-Condition-Action Rule Schema, you need programming backgrounds in JavaScript.

## How to Use This Guide

In general, this guide assumes that you’re reading it in sequence from front to back. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters might not delve into details on a topic; we typically revisit the topic in a later chapter.

You’ll find two kinds of chapters in this guide: concept chapters and project chapters. In concept chapters, you’ll learn about an aspect of openHAB X. In project chapters, we’ll build small demonstrations together, applying what you’ve learned so far.

The chapters are outlined like this:

This guide fully embraces the potential of openHAB X to empower its users. It’s a friendly and approachable text intended to help you level up not just your knowledge of this system, but also your reach and confidence in Home Automation in general. So dive in, get ready to learn — and welcome to the openHAB X community!
